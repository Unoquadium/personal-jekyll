My girlfriend runs a [cooking blog](http://nagelsbagels.wordpress.com).

It occured to me today that she never runs out of ideas of what to make in the kitchen. Maybe it's a gift and a curse - she always [has to cook](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/428/084/676.jpg).

It made me think of what my life would be like if I always had large web projects to work on - turning me into a perpetual coding machine of sorts. I don't think it would be nearly as fun as hacking out an idea I'm passionate about - building it out and releasing it and refining it and seeing it become a community's child. Alas, that idea has not shown itself to me yet.

While seeking inspiration (or just looking to kill time), I picked up a copy of [*Rework*](http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745), a business book written by the two main guys at 37signals, whose Rails software has been on my mind for the majority of this summer. I found *Rework* to be heavily inspiring, even as a guy who never seriously considered running a business.

*Rework* didn't make me jump out of my (really comfortable) seat and become a "starter", but it did offer me bite-sized portions of something I value deeply - common sense. These nuggets of sanity really settled in my brain, and I often found myself reading a chapter and thinking about some practices I've seen go in the exact opposite direction of *Rework*'s advice, even if they originally started out with the same intent.

While reading a chapter titled "Underdo your competition," I was suddenly reminded of an idea I had about two months ago. It wasn't a full app idea like the dream I described earlier, but just a fun project that I could use to really dig into Rails on my own - something I've been meaning to do since I finished Michael Hartl's beautiful [*Rails Tutorial*](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book).

Of course, me getting inspired to build this project seems to have nothing to do with the presumable contents of a chapter called "Underdo your competition." But somewhere between the Cold War and fixie bikes references, it happened.

Now, what becomes of this idea remains to be seen, but I do think that now is my time to get into Rails. While I still have time...

It calls me.

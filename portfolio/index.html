					To acommodate a complete redesign of their web platform, Waspit needed a new
					marketing website to promote all its new features. Working with the creative director,
					I fully built the marketing website from the ground up using the Yii framework. In
					addition to the site, I also implemented a <a href="/images/waspit-marketing/Waspit-backend.png">backend</a>
					that was used by the marketing team to manage site content and to keep track of the
					company's nationwide campus ambassador program.

					The ambassador portal was created for Waspit's remote ambassadors
					to keep track of their progress during their summer internships. The
					portal gathered data from the registration system and
					presented it in a way that kept the ambassadors active and engaged
					in the program. It was also used by the marketing team to post
					files, announcements, and to highlight ambassadors who stood out.

					This minisite was created as a companion to the old Waspit marketing site, mainly
					as a recruiting tool for its remote ambassador program. The website
					described some of the new platform's features and hosted a video
					challenge in which contestants uploaded videos and their friends
					supported them via social media and voting. Contestants were able
					to enter the challenge right on the minisite as well.

					To raise awareness for the company's service and ambassador program,
					Waspit ran a Spring Break Challenge. The goal of the challenge was
					to send some ambassadors and their friends to Panama City Beach, Florida 
					for spring break. Contestants were able to enter and upload videos right
					through the challenge site, and their friends had the ability to support
					contestants through social media and voting.

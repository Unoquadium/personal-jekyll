			To acommodate a complete redesign of their web platform, Waspit needed a new
			marketing website to promote all its new features. Working with the creative director,
			I fully built the marketing website from the ground up using the Yii framework. In
			addition to the site, I also implemented a <a href="/images/Waspit-backend.png">backend</a>
			that was used by the marketing team to manage site content and to keep track of the
			company's nationwide campus ambassador program.

  <h3>About This</h3>
  <p>
  	This website is half personal site and half experimental venture into Ruby
  	and its web stack. You can find the source over at
  	<a href="https://github.com/Unoquadium/personal-jekyll" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  	It is built by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and deployed
  	on my awesome <a href="https://linode.com" target="_blank">Linode</a>.

  <h3>About Me</h3>

  	<div id="me">
  		<img id="selfie" src="/images/r_about.jpg" alt="Ilya Rubnich" />
	  	<p>
	  		My name is Ilya. I'm a web developer.<br />
	  		Despite the Ruby-ness of this website, I'm actually
	  		more of a PHP guy trying to broaden my horizons.
	  		<br><br>
	  		I have experience in all parts of the web stack, from a server's
	  		LAMP software to the HTML you see here. I'm fluent in PHP, JavaScript,
	  		CSS, and HTML. I also work with SQL databases, Linux servers, MVC frameworks,
	  		and all sorts of fun APIs.
	  		<br><br>
	  		I attend The City College of New York, working on my BS
	  		in Computer Science.
	  		<br><br>
	  		Apart from being a code monkey, I also dabble in music.
	  		I'd totally be an audio engineer if given the chance.
	  		<br><br>
	  		If you want to talk to me, drop me an email at irubnich@gmail.com, or hit
	  		me up on any of the social networks up in the header. You can grab a copy
	  		of my resume <a href="#">here</a>.

  <h1>About This</h1>

	  		<img id="selfie" src="/images/r_about.jpg" alt="Ilya Rubnich" />
	  		My name is Ilya.<br />
	  		I'm a web developer practicing said trade at
	  		<a href="https://waspit.me/" target="_blank">Waspit</a>.<br>
	  		Despite the obvious Ruby-ness of this website, I'm actually<br>
	  		more of a PHP guy trying to broaden my horizons.
	  		<br><br>
	  		I attend The City College of New York working on my BS<br>
	  		in Computer Science.
	  		<br><br>
	  		Apart from being a code monkey, I also dabble in music.<br>
	  		I'd totally be an audio engineer if given the chance.
